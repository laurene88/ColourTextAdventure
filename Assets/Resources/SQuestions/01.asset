  question: "The industrial area roads are lined with dark grey factory buildings
    and heavy trucks come and go through large garage doors. Even though all these
    buildings are all purpose built for efficient production, the feel of the area
    is slow. As long as you are wearing the appropriate workers uniform - rough clothes,
    work boots, and perhaps a fluoro safety vest for good luck, you can blend right
    in. Dressed this way, I walk straight through one of the open garage doors to
    a spray painted office door in the back of the building. The windows on this
    small container office are opaque to provide a little privacy. As planned, I\u2019m
    the last one to arrive for the meeting, A C and D are all inside. \u201CAah here
    he is\u201D says A. \u201CReady to lock in the final plan?\u201D"
