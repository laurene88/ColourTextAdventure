  question: "C is the latest I have bought in, completing our quartet. This will
    be their first job with the team. We needed someone with technical programming
    expertise. C initially worked in the computing world where I had some positive
    impressions working with them at my prior day job. However, they earned more
    of my attention after they left that company to continue their own, more lucrative
    computer business full time. Thanks to their knowledge combining technology,
    security, and finance, they should be a massive asset to the team. Although they
    will be a huge asset academically, I\u2019m eager to see how they manage during
    the actual heist. The physical requirements and tense atmosphere will be more
    than they are used to sitting behind a computer screen. I\u2019m hoping they
    can help the team be more\u2026"
