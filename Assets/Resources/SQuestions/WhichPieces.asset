  question: "\u201CWhich pieces are you thinking of?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, maybe
    just the painting of the meadow in the other room, and the portrait of the girl
    there. Those two are the next most valuable ones in here, we can put them with
    our solid colour painting.\u201D\r\n\r\nTheres silence in the room as we all
    consider this outrageous option.\r\n\r\n\u201CYea, I think we should do it.\u201D
    Says Ava to break the silence. \u201CWere already here with all the gear.\u201D"
